# Shorten URL Frontend

This is a simple full stack app using Node, React, MongoDB atlas.

The UI is entirely made using plain React and Tailwind. This project is very lightweight on frontend concepts and here i was mainly trying to achieve node implementation
of URL shortning.

UI :

It has basic features like adding a new long URL and generating its corresponding small url or deleting the same. 

For insight about the Backend code and architecture you can checkout backend repo : https://github.com/Akshay-Mohan-99/url_shortner_backend

Hope you learn and got an idea about the overall working of the application. 

Cheers !!
